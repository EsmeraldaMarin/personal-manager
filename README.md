### LOG IN üöÄ

The first thing you should do when you initialize the live server is to select the "public" folder, which is where the ".html" files are located, then you must log in or create a user. The API will allow you to log in if the data entered matches those of the logged in user. The API will allow you to create a user as long as you meet the specified requirements (do not repeat the user's email already created, repeat the password, fill in all the fields).
